  <h2><mark>Profile</mark></h2>
  <strong>Work Authorization:</strong> Canadian Citizen 

<strong>Summary:</strong> Threat hunting, threat detection engineering, network security monitoring, incident investigation, open-source threat identification and remedy.</br>
<p>
I am an open-minded, pragmatic, and optimistic individual that passionately believes that technology can change the world. I am also a highly motivated Cybersecurity Analyst with1 years of experience in IT, bridging cybersecurity frameworks and risk management. I have experience creating, developing, and maintaining cybersecurity maturity regarding product security through active engagement with engineering teams, and application owners. I have great attention to detail, with a strong focus on the incident response process.</br>

I have previously performed system assessments, defined and worked on implementation of approved security controls, managed product related vulnerabilities and tracked any mitigations done in a timely manner. I can improve the risk acceptance process to help establish control-related procedures while working towards building relevant security metrics and dashboards.</br> 

I ensure that I maintain information security policies, standards, procedures, and technical security baselines as applicable.</br>

I can monitor networks and computer systems for suspicious or unmated activity, investigate the root cause and impact of the activity, and ensure any related security issues are remediated. I excel at using a combination of technical tools, analysis techniques, intuition, and soft skills to identify, investigate, respond to, and report instances of or trends in anomalous activity.</br>

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
